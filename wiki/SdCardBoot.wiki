#summary How to place root filesystem on SD/MMC card

= Introduction =
Sometimes, when kernel is big enough, it fails to mount initrd. This seems to be the bootloader issue. In this case we place root filesystem on a card.

== Formatting ==
Format your SD card and make 2 partitions:
  #  FAT partition for storing HaRET, initrd and kernel.
  #  Ext2 or Ext3 partition for root filesystem.

Then transfer the required files to the rootfs partition:

  cp -pR path/to/rootfs path/to/second/partition


You can transfer the contents of initrd.img.gz to the card. To do this, unarchive the file, mount it, and copy as above.

  mount -o loop initrd.img /mnt/initrd
